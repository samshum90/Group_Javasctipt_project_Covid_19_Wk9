#### Background Information

COVID-19 has seriously affected human lives and the economy of the World causing untold physical, mental and financial hardship for many. The population of the UK and Northern Ireland is self isolating but many people without family and friendsâ€™ are vulnerable and need help from other people. Key workers and volunteers across all sectors are exhausted from the many hours they are devoting to help those vulnerable people.

This App is designed to help the volunteers find those that need help in their area and to assist them in any way they can. 

This is the purpose of Angela.
